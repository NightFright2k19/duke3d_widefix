                                  WIDESCREEN FIXES FOR DUKE NUKEM 3D
                                =======================================
                                      Version: 1.6 / Jul 11, 2025

A B O U T
================================================================================================

This file provides widescreen graphics to make Duke Nukem 3D look a bit more polished and 
visually "complete" for EDuke32 users.

What you get:
-------------
> Widescreen graphics (statusbar, weapons, menu)
  Fox made a really nice widescreen statusbar for the game. I improved a few pixels here
  and there and increased its width a bit to cover higher screen resolutions.
  Widescreen-compatible weapons for Duke Nukem 3D and Life's A Beach made by Jimmy are also
  included, only loaded when the same tiles are not replaced by custom mods.
  Finally, the most important menu tiles have been provided as widescreen versions, covering
  original Duke3D and all addons.

> 8-bit redfont from Duke3D v1.3D
  With the Atomic Edition, 3D Realms switched to a new menu font that was much thicker
  than the one that came with the initial release of the game. Many liked the previous
  font better, so here it is. I took the 8-bit version of the redfont from the HRP 
  (made by SwissCM) and integrated it into .art files with some palette fixes (so the
  characters would also look OK in custom content).


================================================================================================
R E Q U I R E M E N T S
================================================================================================

1) Duke Nukem 3D groupfile (duke3d.grp, preferrably v1.5 Atomic Edition)
 
2) One of the supported ports:
   - EDuke32 (http://dukeworld.duke4.net/eduke32/synthesis)
   - Rednukem (https://lerppu.net/wannabethesis)
   - Raze (https://github.com/ZDoom/Raze/releases)

Note about DukeGDX: 
This port comes with its own widescreen graphics (even though without widescreen menu
tiles which are not supported) and therefore won't require this mod. 


================================================================================================
I N S T A L L A T I O N
================================================================================================

1) Extract "duke3d_widefix.zip" into your EDuke32 autoload dir.

2) Make sure "Enable 'autoload' folder" option is checked in EDuke32 launcher. 

3) Launch EDuke32.


================================================================================================
N O T E S
================================================================================================

This patch is meant for users who prefer to play without the Highres Pack (HRP).
Using the HRP and this at the same time is redundant as you would have highres replacements 
for statusbar and menu font which make the graphics provided with this file useless.

================================================================================================

v1.6 / 2025-07-11
-----------------
- Updated: 2544 (RPG) and 2550 (Freezer) from HTTK Edition
- Updated: Ep.2/3 ending panels (3292, 3293) reverted to original 4:3 ratio for text parts
           with minor adjustments/corrections
- Updated: Closed 1px wide gap on Freezer firing frame (2550)
- Updated: Image stretching removed for 3DR logo (2492)
- Fixed: Improper alignment of Freezer firing sprites (2551-2553)
- Removed: DukeGDX support 
           While it would have been possible to get weapon sprites working by converting
           ifcrc values from hex to decimals and removing the unsupported artquality parameter
           in the skybox defs, DukeGDX apparently does not support proper centering of 
           widescreen tiles for menu graphics.
           This however eliminates the main difference between this mod and the widescreen 
           graphics that are provided with the DukeGDX port. Until measures are taken to 
           provide proper port-sided support, DukeGDX support has to be removed, along with 
           the skyboxes.

           the 5:4 version
